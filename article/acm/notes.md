### ToDo
- Confirm institutional ties of authors and their names in English.
- Obtain grant numbers (e.g. FAPESP from Chu)
- Ask Chu not to collapse multiple lines into one.
- Put references in ??
- Are there boundaries on sound wavelengths in micro or macro scales?
- write about the literature (from the appendix)
- write a section with tables with all the scripts and related equations, musics and figures.
- write a section on synonyms and ambiguities?
- write about the extreme quality of massa synthesis which uses 64bits per sample,
updates on the synthesis parameters sample-by-sample, and lookup tables with arbitrary size and sample precision.
Make explicit that there are a lot of discussion among specialists on the impact of sample rate and bit depth, for example, and that music software often uses 16 or 24bit bit depth and audio chunks to make synthesis lighter.
- review the code from each section, for the figures, aux and that render music. Make an additional EP routine.
- enhance first figures. Change espectrum for spectrum and , for . in figure 3.
- place figures in best places.
- note to other authors that we have many footnotes.
- make an index in the beginning of each section or of the article. E.g. spatial location or spatialization is not even cited until the subsection is reached. Maybe make the index as an appendix or put it in the introduction, relating concepts, equations and implementations (files and line numbers).
- change name of musical pieces to english.
- homogenize capitalization in section titles and inline references.
- Unify the citation of the massa toolbox
- remove piece names in the beginning of the third section.
- state in the introduction that, in fact, most pieces in massa are not very traditional in their sonorities and discourse- review equation layouts.
- give better names to musical pieces
- move localization and reverberation to the third section of make an explicit account the hybrid aspect off them.
- state in the cover letter that we can reduce the size of the article if needed, e.g. by describing the musical pieces/usage in an supporting information document.
- account for phrases and melody construction.
- account for spectral music composition.
- account for sonic textures.
- see music composition in wikipedia.
- is an octave a simple or compound interval?
- make a disclaimer in the introduction or the fourth chapter that there are many theoretical framework for music and that most often there is not a single way to express or characterize musical structures.
Therefore, the article contains many adjectives such as "often" "commonly" "frequently" and they might be even more numerous if we wanted to be very precise.
- account for spectral music and other post-serial techniques.
- better account for serial techniques.
- maybe change the order of some sections. E.g. put tonal harmony before atonal harmony, put motives right before tunning, etc.
- Make explicit that one merit of the article is the effort to sum up musical theory, many more discussions can be easelly added but we believe that from the article on, the reader can look into other articles and books.
- explain what is a measure (and maybe what is a bar) in the rhythm section.
